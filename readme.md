## Calendar Editor (schedule.json creator)
How it works:
1. If you have a file, uploaded it, then check to make sure the schedules are acceptable, if not, press cancel and upload a different file.
2. Input your own schedules how you see fit. **make sure you enter # periods correctly. If not, you'll have to create another schedule**
3. Choose which schedule corresponds to which day of the week.
4. Download the file!
